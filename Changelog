GKrellMSS - GKrellM Sound Scope Changelog


2.7 Mon Oct 7, 2010
--------------------
	* Don't err out if can't set the ALSA bufsize we want.  Just continue
	  on with whatever ALSA has.
	* Add more/better error reporting when opening ALSA fails.


2.6 Mon May 17, 2004
--------------------
	* Removed snd_pcm_wait() call where alsa thread started hanging in latest
	  alsa version.
	* Russion ru.po update from Alex Murygin, and fix a missed translation.

2.5 Sat May 15, 2004
--------------------
	* Fix small chart decal display glitch when running under gkrellm >= 2.2.0.

2.4 Fri Feb 20, 2004
--------------------
	* Add ALSA as a sound source if available.  Compile in multiple sound
	  sources if available and dynamically switch between them via a menu
	  popup from a button on the chart.
	  Default compiles in support for both ALSA and Esound if available, but
	  either may be selectively omitted with a make option.  Run "make help".
	* Alsa support is for ALSA >= 0.9.7 (probably) and support for old
	  ALSA 0.5 is dropped.
	* Run esdctl commands for Esound standby/resume from the options menu.
	* Use fftw3 if available, otherwise fall back to fftw2.
	* Russian ru.po translation from Alex Murygin <murygin--at--aitoc.com>

2.3 Mon Nov 25, 2002
--------------------
	* Made it work nicely with theme scaling if compiled under at
	  least GKrellM 2.1.1 headers.
	* Fix Makefile to compile under Darwin.

2.2 Mon Oct 21, 2002
--------------------
	* gkrellmss.c wouldn't compile under pre 2.1 gkrellm.h header.

2.1 Tue Oct 15, 2002
--------------------
	* If compiled with GKrellM >= 2.1.0 headers, use the
	  gkrellm_spacers_set_types() function so gkrellm will know this is a
	  hybrid monitor type (ie. chart on top of a meter panel).
	  This will allow the right cap and spacer images to be applied for
	  themes that have them.

2.0 Tue Aug 27, 2002
--------------------
	* Final changes for GKrellM 2.0.
	* Cleaned namespace.
	* Fixed i18n setup.

1.0 pre
--------
	* Ported to GKrellM 2.0 / Gtk+-2.0

0.5 Sat Jun 15, 2002
--------------------
    * Added sdlib-alsa5.c for an ALSA 0.5 version.

0.4 Mon Feb 25, 2002
--------------------
	* This GKrellMSS version requires at least GKrellM version 1.2.9.
	* Added a spectrum analyzer mode.
	* Changed toggle of chart labels from left to middle click so left
	  click can select frequency to highlight.
	* gkrellmrc settings of krell parameters now uses custom StyleMeter
	  lines instead of set-integer lines.  All themes I'm aware of that
	  have custom GKrellMSS images happen to have not put custom values
	  in the gkrellmrc, so I'm not aware of any theme breakage.  See the
	  Themes file.
	* It wasn't a misspelling so much as bad eyes, but you can now have
	  the images button_sweep_dn.png and button_sweep_up.png instead of
	  buttom_sweep_dn.png and buttom_sweep_up.png.  The slightly more
	  descriptive "buttom" is also accepted for backward compatibility :)


0.3 Sun Oct 14, 2001
--------------------
	* Prevent potential segfault by making sure vert_sensitivity can't become
	  zero if there is a faulty read from config.  This could happen if a user
	  switches from using enabled<->non-enabled locale versions of gkrellm.


0.2 Sat Aug 25, 2001
--------------------
	* If esd died, there was no way to reconnect.  So added a click on chart
	  to reconnect.


0.1	Wed Aug 22, 2001
--------------------
	* Initial release

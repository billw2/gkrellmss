The default make compiles a GKrellMSS plugin with support for
both Esound and ALSA >= 0.9.7 if they are available.  Either
fftw3 or fftw2 is required.

Just:

    make
    make install

Installs gkrellmss.so in /usr/local/lib/gkrellm2/plugins.
To install into /usr/lib/gkrellm2/plugins:

    make install PREFIX=/usr

Or, you can manually install under your home directory with:

    install src/gkrellmss.so ~/.gkrellm2/plugins

The default install of translation files is to /usr/share/locale,
so you should probably do a "make install" as root.  However, if you
don't want any translation files installed, you can probably run
as a normal user:

    make install enable_nls=0

=====================================================================
When you run gkrellm, go to the plugins page of the config
and enable "Sound Scope".

Note to distribution packagers:
    Run "make help" for how to compile gkrellmss with support for either
    Esound or ALSA disabled.
